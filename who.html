<p> Welcome to my webiste! My name is Nikos Chrysogelos and I am currently studying at <a href="http://www.ece.ntua.gr/index.php?lang=en">
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science </a> . I was born on Saturday 10 March 1990 in Athens (10/03 is also the birthday of 
<a href="http://www.olympiacos.org/">Olympiakos</a>!). I like reading books, learn new things and especially find out the 
truth for lies my parents have told me during my childhood ( and I don't mean Santa Claus but greek history and mainly 
political and religious history). I have 3 brothers and 3 sisters ( 7 children - god blesses my parents). </p>

<p> Moreover I love sports ,football, basketball, volleyball , running. I used to play at my school's basketball team
which claimed the gold metal for two consecutive years! I also like playing football (american soccer) with my friends on Saturday afternoons.
</p>

<p> I enjoy playing chess , solving challenging algorithmic/mathematical problems, "teaching" my little 
brother and see the world through his eyes. I like travelling (when I have money) in Europe. Finally I am a maniac-collector of the first pages
of <a href="http://www.athensvoice.gr/the-paper">Athens Voice </a> since 2007 (watch them , they are brilliant!)</p>


<p> During the last year I have been working at Cern which gave me the oppurtunity to become a guide at CMS exmpirement. My interest in science also motivated me to participate in students' workshop which aimed to bring them in touch with great engineering developments and physics updates taking place at Cern. Here is one interesting project in which I helped them to discover the Higgs boson through the data obtained by CMS!Enjoy! </p>
