 <p> During my studies at NTUA I was involved in the research project <b>Implementation of European 7th Framework Research Project - Development of new Transistors and Power inverter using Normally-ON SiC JFETs for PV applications </b> , on which I worked full time for my thesis. Mainly two papers have been published so far while there are others which are currently processed for conferences of this year</p>

<p> On 2013-2014 I worked under the Tracker Group of Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment in Physics Department at Cern.I was involved mainly in two projects. The first one has to do with the design and the monitor of the control system of the new cooling plant installed for the Tracker Detector of CMS experiment using PLC systems. The second one was the preparation, calibration, installation and development of a network of dew-point (silicon and fiber optic) sensors targeted to online monitoring at critical areas of the CMS Tracker sealing in view of the post Long Shutdown. Technical reports are published below.</p>
